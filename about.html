        <p>Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD
             students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly
              listed shares and control 56% of the stockholder voting power through super-voting stock.
               The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was

                  2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet
